<h3 id="quick-start"><a href="#quick-start" class="anchor"></a>Quick Start</h3><p>Before you crank up your documenting knob and write some of your best docs, we need to do some setup.</p><p>We will need 3 things. Only 3, but I promise we're working on making this be zero things. Okay, let's do this!</p><ol><li>Install <code>opam</code> ‚Äî you can check their amazing documentation <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html">here</a>.</li><li>Create an <code>opam switch</code> with version <code>4.02.3+buckle-master</code> ‚Äî <code>opam switch
	create 4.02.3+buckle-master</code></li><li>Install <code>odoc</code> ‚Äî <code>opam install odoc</code></li></ol><p>That should be the setup you need to generate documentation. If you want to learn more about <b>why</b> do we need all this, please read on!</p><p>Now finally we can run <code>yarn add bsdoc</code> to install.</p><p>Make sure to save it as a development time dependency, to include it in your <code>bsconfig.json</code>, and that you have a <code>package-spec</code> that build CommonJS out of source:</p><pre><code class="ml">//...
  &quot;package-specs&quot;: [
    // ...
    { &quot;module&quot;: &quot;commonjs&quot;, &quot;in-source&quot;: false },
  ],
  &quot;bs-dependencies&quot;: [
    // ...
    &quot;bsdoc&quot;,
  ],
// ...</code></pre><h3 id="generating-docs"><a href="#generating-docs" class="anchor"></a>Generating Docs</h3><p>To generate your documentation it's enough to just run:</p><ol><li><code>yarn run bsdoc support-files</code> ‚Äî one time, to get everything setup!</li><li><code>yarn run bsdoc build &lt;PkgName&gt;</code> ‚Äî any time you want to rebuild your package docs.</li></ol><p>You can use the very sensible defaults used to generate <code>bsdoc</code> docs, or you can customize plenty of parameters. Try adding `--help` in any command to see more details on all the parameters available, their behavior, and their default values.</p><h3 id="a-byte-of-insight..."><a href="#a-byte-of-insight..." class="anchor"></a>A Byte of Insight...</h3><p><code>bsdoc</code> is really just an <em>orchestrating</em> tool, and like any orchestrator it orchestrates <em>something else</em>. In this case, that something else is <code>odoc</code>. <code>odoc</code> (<a href="https://ocaml.github.io/odoc">Homepage</a>) is a documentation compiler, and it's not meant to be used directly by a human. Instead, <code>odoc</code> is designed to be used by a higher level tool that makes your life easier. One such tools is this one, <code>bsdoc</code>.</p><p>As a documentation compiler, <code>odoc</code> can do great things with the language features, such as automatically letting you know that your links are broken because some type-definitions have changed. It's really quite useful.</p><h3 id="tips-&amp;-tricks"><a href="#tips-&amp;-tricks" class="anchor"></a>Tips &amp; Tricks</h3><h4 id="keep-your-docs-in-your-interfaces!"><a href="#keep-your-docs-in-your-interfaces!" class="anchor"></a>Keep your Docs in your Interfaces!</h4><p>It's easy to fall trap of inline-documentation, and doing so in the middle of the complexity of your code can make it even harder to read and understand. Don't forget that in Reason and OCaml the type system can easily tell you exactly what the type of anything is, so learn the editor shortcut for that instead and I promise you'll find reading your code much more enjoyable.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, begin a module with a `.rei` or `.mli` and begin by documenting what things are, not how they are internally. This normally means that you'll want to just say you have a type, but not really describe what's inside of it or how it's going to be used.</p><pre><code class="ml">/** 
  The Infinity Stone type is the most powerful type in the Universe. Very few
  can wield its powers!
  */
type infinity_stone;</code></pre><p>This is also a best practice of OCaml module design! So it's a huge win-win for you as a documentation writer, and you as a great module designer.</p><h4 id="no-bs-publishing-to-github"><a href="#no-bs-publishing-to-github" class="anchor"></a>No-BS Publishing to Github</h4><p>Github nowadays allows you to publish documentation from the same branch your code is on. This is useful for 2 reasons:</p><ol><li>It's easy to see what version of the docs is released, it's the docs on the master branch.</li><li>It's easy to update the docs, just regenerate them on the master branch.</li></ol><p>But there's one small problem when using this feature. If you started using <code>odoc</code> or <code>bsdoc</code> you'll be quick to realize that the generated documentation lives <em>one folder below your docs folder</em>. That is, if your package name is <code>ReactReason</code>, and your docs folder is <code>./docs</code>, then your main <code>index.html</code> file will be here:</p><pre><code class="ml">ReasonReact
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ReasonReact
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html</code></pre><p>A small fix for this, really just a small hack, is to include an <code>index.html</code> file inside your <code>./docs</code> folder with a small <code>&lt;meta /&gt;</code> redirect:</p><pre><code class="ml">&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;0;URL='./ReasonReact'&quot; /&gt;</code></pre><p>That'll let you publish your docs üôåüèº</p></div></body></html>
